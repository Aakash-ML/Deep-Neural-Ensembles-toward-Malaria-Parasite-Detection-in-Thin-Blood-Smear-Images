# Deep-Neural-Ensembles-toward-Malaria-Parasite-Detection-in-Thin-Blood-Smear-Images
This study evaluates the performance of custom and pretrained CNNs and construct an optimal model ensemble toward the challenge of classifying parasitized and normal cells in thin blood smear images. The results obtained are encouraging and superior to the state-of-the-art.
